# Monthly Variance of Global Land-Surface Temperature.

## Description
This is the second data visualization project from freeCodeCamp.org, using D3. The project tests require non-virtual DOM elements, so a front-end framework (React) will not be used.  

## Usage
This is a heat map showing Monthly Variance of Global Land-Surface Temperature by visualizing land-surface temps with a heat map. The dataset is provided by freeCodeCamp in the project instructions. Here is the [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map) for the project.
